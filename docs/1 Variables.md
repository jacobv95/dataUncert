```

## Units
The unit is used to determine which computations can be performed:
 - Two variables can be added together or subtracted from each other if their units are identical
 - Any two units can be multiplied or divided
 - Exponents cannot have any units
 - A variable with a unit can be raised to an integer power
 - The n'th root of a variable can be taken if the exponent of the unit of the variable is divisible by n

The denominator and the numerator of the unit is seperated using a dash (/).
The units in the denominator or numerator are sperated using a hyphen (-)
